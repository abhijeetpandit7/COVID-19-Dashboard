			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>
					Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.
				</li>
				<li>
					COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, a city in China, in December 2019. Early hypotheses thought it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China suggesting animal-to-person spreaad.
				</li>
				<li>
					However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.
				</li>
				<li>
					The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo", which refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a crown.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="heading mb-4">How does the new coronavirus spread?</p>
			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>
					As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
				</li>
				<li>
					The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds â€” this is why social and physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="heading mb-4">What are symptoms of COVID-19?</p>
			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>Cough</li>
				<li>Fever</li>
				<li>Shortness of breath</li>
				<li>Muscle aches</li>
				<li>Sore throat</li>
				<li>Unexplained loss of taste or smell</li>
				<li>Diarrhea</li>
				<li>Headache</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="heading mb-4">How do you protect yourself from this coronavirus?</p>
			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>
					Practice social and physical distancing: Stay at least six feet away from others in public places.
				</li>
				<li>
					Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing (which should then be disposed of immediately), or with a sleeve if a tissue is not available.
				</li>
				<li>
					The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol by volume (or 120 proof) when soap and water are not readily available.
				</li>
				<li>
					The WHO also advise people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="heading mb-4">What to do if you feel sick?</p>
			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>
					Stay home if you feel sick unless you are experiencing a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath or a very high fever.
				</li>
				<li>
					Call your doctor or urgent care facility and explain your symptoms over the phone.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you leave your home to get medical care, wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="heading mb-4">How is COVID-19 treated?</p>
			<ul class="bulletins px-5">
				<li>
					As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus.
				</li>
				<li>
					People who become sick from COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the WHO, has stated "there is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir."
				</li>
